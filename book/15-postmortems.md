# Postmortems

The primary goal of writing postmortems is

- Ensure that the incident is documented
- All contributing root cause(s) are well understood
- Preventive actions are put in place

See [Google's example postmortem](https://sre.google/sre-book/example-postmortem/).

> Blameless postmortems are a tenet of SRE culture. For a postmortem to be truly blameless, it must focus on identifying the contributing causes of the incident without indicting any individual or team for bad or inappropriate behavior. A blamelessly written postmortem assumes that everyone involved in an incident had good intentions and did the right thing with the information they had.
