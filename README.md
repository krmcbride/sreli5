Google's seminal book [Site Reliability Engineering](https://sre.google/sre-book/table-of-contents/) defines what it means _implement devops_ (according to Google). It provides a fantastic blueprint for those of us in the industry, but at 34 chapters and 500+ pages, I find even though I've read the book multiple times, my brain has difficulty ingesting so much information. This project (SRE - Explain Like I'm 5), attempts to distill the material down to the core concepts and provides checklists with which to "grade" one's own SRE practices.

(This is very much a work in progress)
